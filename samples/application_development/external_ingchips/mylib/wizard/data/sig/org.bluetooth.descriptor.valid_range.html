Two mandatory fields are contained (upper and lower bounds) which define the range.<h5>Summary</h5>If the Characteristic Value to which this descriptor is attached has a fixed exponent, then the values in this descriptor have the same exponent. The first value in the Valid Range descriptor represents the lower inclusive value of the range. The second value represents the higher inclusive value of the range. The data type and units for lower inclusive value and the upper inclusive value are identical to the data type and units of the characteristic for which it is used.<h5>Examples</h5><p>When used with the Measurement Interval characteristic, the Valid Range descriptor is formatted using a uint16. If the valid range has a Minimum Value of 10 minutes (600 seconds) and a Maximum Value of 2 hours (7200 seconds) the value of the Valid Range descriptor would be expressed as: 0x58 0x02 0x20 0x1C</p><p>A characteristic that is formatted using a nibble with a fixed decimal-exponent that has a Valid Range of 2 to 13 has a Valid Range descriptor defined as: 0x02 0x0D</p><p>A characteristic value that is formatted using an sint16 with a fixed exponent of -1 that has a Valid Range of -40 to +85 is expressed as: 0x70 0xFE 0x52 0x03</p><h5>Value</h5><table border="1"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Requirement</th><th>Format</th><th>Note</th></tr><tr><td>Lower inclusive value<br/><a href=""><h6></h6></a><br/>The lower bound is the same format as the characteristic the descriptor describes.</td><td>Mandatory</td><td>characteristic</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Upper inclusive value<br/><a href=""><h6></h6></a><br/>The upper bound is the same format as the characteristic the descriptor describes.</td><td>Mandatory</td><td>characteristic</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>
